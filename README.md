# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic filter on a webpage for data that has been collected on UFO sightings.

The site we built will serve as a one stop shop for key data points collected on UFO sightings and will show sheeple around the globe that the aliens are real.

## Results

How to use the new site:

Go to the Filter Search section of the website.  ![Filters.png] (https://github.com/pritchardjeff/UFOs/blob/master/ReadMe_Support/Filters.png)

Enter your desired filter criteria, for this example we will look for triangle shaped UFOs in California.

Enter triangle and ca into the filter. Should look like the following:  ![Sample_Filters.png] (https://github.com/pritchardjeff/UFOs/blob/master/ReadMe_Support/Sample_Filters.png)

The data table should look like the image below.

## Summary

The main drawback to this site is that the data set is static and needs to be updated manually. 

### Possible Improvements

To improve the site, I would reccomend we layer in a webscraping component that pulls in the most recent data on UFO sightings.

Another feature we could add would be some sort of tracking feature that identifies similarly shaped UFOs and plots a pathway of where they have been spotted based on the date and geo location. If we can get the application to the point where we could potentially predict future sitings, we could create another app that pushes notifications to our fellow woke brothers and sisters around the world and notifies them of potential future sightings.
